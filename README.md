Stash Add-on
============

Adds "stash" and "restore" menu items to the tools menu.

"stash" will prompt for a name, then save the current window's tabs and close
the window.

"restore" will create a new window with those tabs and remove the saved stash.

Why?
====

I work by creating a window for each bug and keeping related tabs within that
window.  Because I tend to have multiple windows open at once
tabgroups/panorama doesn't work well for me.

Unfortunately there's a noticable performance impact for keeping a large number
of windows open (I generally have at least 30 bugs on the go at once), so I
started bookmarking all tabs and closing windows.

This works but the process to update and remove bookmark groups is clumsy --
this add-on streamlines that process for me.
